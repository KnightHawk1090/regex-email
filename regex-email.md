# Regex Email Tutorial

Regular Expression, or as it is more commonly known Regex, is a great tool that is used for extracting specific information from strings that are based on predined patterns. The characters within a regex represent a rule that helps define the desired pattern. Regex is also used to validate input fields such as usernames, passwords, and email addresses.
